Remote Monitoring and Control API Tests
Overview
This test project is designed to ensure the correctness and reliability of the Remote Monitoring and Control API. It includes both unit tests and integration tests to validate endpoints, database operations, and overall application behavior. The tests simulate the API’s runtime environment using WebApplicationFactory and leverage an In-Memory Database to provide isolated and fast test runs.

Project Structure
Key Components:

Unit Tests: Validate specific logic for individual API endpoints and methods.

Integration Tests: Ensure that the complete API works as expected in an in-memory environment.

Test Utilities: Include helper classes for mock data, authentication utilities, and setup configurations.

Requirements
Tools and Dependencies:

.NET SDK: Version 9.0 or higher.

NuGet Packages:

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing: For in-memory API testing.

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory: For an in-memory database during tests.

xUnit: The testing framework.

xunit.runner.visualstudio: Visual Studio test runner integration.

Moq: For mocking dependencies.

Newtonsoft.Json: For advanced JSON operations if needed.

Installation:

Run the following commands to install the required packages:

bash

dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
dotnet add package xunit
dotnet add package xunit.runner.visualstudio
dotnet add package Moq
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json

Test Details
Endpoints Tested
Login (POST /login):

Validates JWT token generation for correct credentials.

Ensures an unauthorized response is returned for invalid credentials.

Command Operations (POST /command, PUT /command, GET /command):

Checks that commands are correctly added to the database.

Ensures updates to existing commands are handled properly.

Validates retrieval of individual commands.

Verifies proper error responses (404 for non-existent commands).

Robot Status (GET /status):

Verifies that the robot status is correctly retrieved from the database.

Command History (GET /history):

Ensures that the history of commands is properly retrieved.

Testing Framework
Uses WebApplicationFactory to create an in-memory instance of the API.

Utilizes an In-Memory Database for realistic, isolated database operations.

Incorporates Moq for mocking dependencies where applicable.

Implements tests for both positive and negative scenarios including missing tokens and invalid operations.

Mock Database
In-Memory Database
Purpose:
Provides a lightweight and fast testing database without the need for a physical database.

Isolation:
Each test run uses an independent dataset ensuring isolated and repeatable test outcomes.

How to Extend Tests
Add New Tests:
Create additional test methods in your test classes (e.g., ProgramTests.cs) to cover new endpoints or features.

Mock New Services:
If new services are added to the API, use Moq to create mocked implementations for testing.

Update Test Configuration:
Adjust the WebApplicationFactory setup in the test constructor to accommodate different application configurations or environments.
